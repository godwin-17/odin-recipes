  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>Make a giant cupcake from scratch with this simple recipe. This amazing giant cupcake will stand out at any birthday, wedding or even just as a little treat! You will need a giant cupcake cake pan.</p>

  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1 ¾ cups white sugar</li>
    <li>1 ½ cups unsalted butter, softened</li>
    <li>2 ¾ cups self-rising flour, sifted</li>
    <li>6 medium eggs, lightly beaten</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). If using a metal giant cupcake pan, thoroughly grease all sides and dust with flour, tapping to remove any excess. If using a silicone cake pan, there is no need to grease.</li>
    <li>Combine sugar and butter in a bowl and beat with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Add in flour alternately with beaten eggs, a little at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in vanilla extract. Divide the mixture between the top and bottom giant cupcake pans.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a tester inserted in the center comes out clean, 50 minutes to 1 hour. Cool in the pan, then turn out to cool completely on a wire rack. Once cool, frost and decorate as desired with your favorite frosting.</li>
  </ol>
